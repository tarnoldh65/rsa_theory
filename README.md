RSA Theory Python Script

I created this python script to help myself and others learn about how the math behind RSA works.

This script can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. The primary keys are small and hardcoded. This is not intended to use as a means of encryption but it does help one to understand the process, which is less complicated than one would think.

I will add more details around this code later but here is how to use it.

```
rsa_theory.py <options>
  -h --help: This help output
  -e --encrypt: encrypt data
  -d --decrypt: decrypt data
  -s --string: string of data to encrypt or decrypt
```
